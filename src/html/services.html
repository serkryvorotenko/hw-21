            An endless stream of contracts, tax issues, labor relations, corporate papers - legal work distracts you
            from doing business. But there is not much work to do to hire an in-house lawyer. <br>
            <br>

            In addition, over time, the work will become the same type and uninteresting for a full-time lawyer. And we
            know very well how difficult it is to find a good candidate with experience in the field of information
            technology in Ukraine.
